{{<info>}}
This document presents the **Nomad** method of installing a Portworx cluster. Please refer to the [Portworx on Kubernetes](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/) page if you want to install Portworx on Kubernetes.
{{</info>}}

This section shows how to install Portworx using a Nomad job.

## Prerequisites

Portworx OCI-monitor container needs to run in privileged mode, so you need to configure your Nomad clients to allow docker containers running on privileged mode.

Add the following lines in your Nomad client configuration files and restart your clients:

```text
options {
   "docker.privileged.enabled" = "true"
}
```

## Install Portworx 

### Create a Nomad job file

Create a new file called `portworx.nomad` and paste into it the content from below:

```text
job "portworx" {
  type        = "service"
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "portworx" {
    count = 3

    constraint {
      operator  = "distinct_hosts"
      value     = "true"
    }

    # restart policy for failed portworx tasks
    restart {
      attempts = 3
      delay    = "30s"
      interval = "5m"
      mode     = "fail"
    }

    # how to handle upgrades of portworx instances
    update {
      max_parallel     = 1
      health_check     = "checks"
      min_healthy_time = "10s"
      healthy_deadline = "5m"
      auto_revert      = true
      canary           = 0
      stagger          = "30s"
    }

    task "px-node" {
      driver = "docker"
      kill_timeout = "120s"   # allow portworx 2 min to gracefully shut down
      kill_signal = "SIGTERM" # use SIGTERM to shut down the nodes

      # consul service check for portworx instances
      service {
        name = "portworx"
        check {
          port     = "portworx"
          type     = "http"
          path     = "/health"
          interval = "10s"
          timeout  = "2s"
        }
      }

      # setup environment variables for px-nodes
      env {
        "AUTO_NODE_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT_IN_SECS" = "1500"
        "PX_TEMPLATE_VERSION"                = "V4"
       }

      # container config
      config {
        image        = "portworx/oci-monitor:2.1.1"
        network_mode = "host"
        ipc_mode = "host"
        privileged = true

        # configure your parameters below
        # do not remove the last parameter (needed for health check)
        args = [
            "-c", "px-cluster-nomadv8",
            "-a",
            "-k", "consul://127.0.0.1:8500",
            "--endpoint", "0.0.0.0:9015"
        ]

        volumes = [
            "/var/cores:/var/cores",
            "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock",
            "/run/containerd:/run/containerd",
            "/etc/pwx:/etc/pwx",
            "/opt/pwx:/opt/pwx",
            "/proc:/host_proc",
            "/etc/systemd/system:/etc/systemd/system",
            "/var/run/log:/var/run/log",
            "/var/log:/var/log",
            "/var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus"
        ]
      }

      # resource config
      resources {
        cpu    = 1024
        memory = 2048

        network {
          mbits = 100
          port "portworx" {
            static = "9015"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that our example installs Portworx on a Nomad cluster with 3 clients.

Don't forget to update:

- the `datacenters` on the file above to fit your environment,
- the `count` to specify the number of nomad nodes you want Portworx to be installed on and
- any constraints you may have.

Also, you can update the arguments as well. Here are the valid arguments you can use:

```text
-c                        [REQUIRED] Specifies the cluster ID that this Portworx instance will join
-k                        [REQUIRED] Points to your key value database, such as an etcd cluster or a consul cluster
-s                        [REQUIRED unless -a is used] Specifies the various drives that Portworx should use for storing the data
-e key=value              [OPTIONAL] Specify extra environment variables
-v <dir:dir[:shared,ro]>  [OPTIONAL] Specify extra mounts
-d <ethX>                 [OPTIONAL] Specify the data network interface
-m <ethX>                 [OPTIONAL] Specify the management network interface
-z                        [OPTIONAL] Instructs Portworx to run in zero storage mode
-f                        [OPTIONAL] Instructs Portworx to use an unmounted drive even if it has a filesystem on it
-a                        [OPTIONAL] Instructs Portworx to use any available, unused and unmounted drives
-A                        [OPTIONAL] Instructs Portworx to use any available, unused and unmounted drives or partitions
-j                        [OPTIONAL] Specifies a journal device for Portworx.  Specify a persistent drive like /dev/sdc or use auto (recommended)
-x <swarm|kubernetes>     [OPTIONAL] Specify scheduler being used in the environment
-r <portnumber>           [OPTIONAL] Specifies the portnumber from which Portworx will start consuming. Ex: 9001 means 9001-9020
```

## Deploy Portworx 

Next, let's deploy `portworx.nomad` by running:

```text
nomad run portworx.nomad
```

## Monitoring the installation process

Check status and wait for all instances to be healthy:

```text
nomad status portworx
```

```output
ID            = portworx
Name          = portworx
Submit Date   = 2019-05-08T00:48:39Z
Type          = service
Priority      = 50
Datacenters   = dc1
Status        = running
Periodic      = false
Parameterized = false

Latest Deployment

Allocations
ID        Node ID   Task Group  Version  Desired  Status   Created   Modified
20a20fd0  e074a6b0  portworx    0        run      running  2m9s ago  23s ago
54f759fa  2299a3b6  portworx    0        run      running  2m9s ago  9s ago
c44ee856  6138409d  portworx    0        run      running  2m9s ago  10s ago
```

You can also follow the logs to wait for Portworx to be ready.

In the example below, I am using the first allocation ID, i.e. 20a20fd0:

```text
nomad alloc logs -f 20a20fd0
```

```output
...
@ip-10-1-1-199 portworx[2414]: time="2019-05-07T15:35:18Z" level=info msg="PX is ready on Node: 6f160613-1fe4-45c4-8d04-079f3bde2921. CLI accessible at /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl."
....
```

After that, you can `ssh` to any one of Nomad clients and check the status using `pxctl`:

```text
pxctl status
```

```output
