### selector

Selects the objects affected by this rule using a matchLabels label selector.

```text
selector:
  matchLabels:
    <selector-key>: <selector-value>
```

### namespaceSelector

Selects the namespaces affected by this rule using a matchLabels label selector.

```text
namespaceSelector:
  matchLabels:
    <selector-key>:<selector-value>
```

### conditions

Defines the metrics that need to be for the rule's actions to trigger.

```text
conditions:
  - key: "<condition-formula>"
    operator: <logical-operator>
    values:
    - "<comparator>"
```

Conditions compare the `key` field with the `values` field using the `operator` field. Condition keys can contain logic and use monitoring values.

{{<info>}}Multiple conditions are combined using a logical AND.{{</info>}}

### actions

Defines what action to take when the conditions are met. See [Supported Actions](#supported-actions) for all actions that you can specify here.

```text
action:
  name: <operation>
  params:
    <operation-specific-paramater>: <value>
```

## Supported Autopilot actions

### openstorage.io.action.volume/resize

This action is to perform resize on Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).

##### Parameters

* **scalepercentage**: Specifies the percentage of current PVC size by which Autopilot should resize the PVC. If not specified, the default is *50%*.
* **maxsize**: Specifies the maximum threshold size in bytes after which Autopilot should stop resizing the PVCs. Note that you can specify the unit of measurement as part of the value. For example, if you want to use GiB, you can specify the unit of measurement like this: `maxsize: "400Gi"`. If not specified, the default value is unlimited.

##### Example

Resize the PVC by 100%.

```text
  actions:
  - name: openstorage.io.action.volume/resize
    params:
      scalepercentage: "100"
```
